# (Almost) single-file implementations of common reinforcement learning algorithms. 

## Most of these algorithms are first implemented in Pytorch, then converted to Jax to leverage the power of JIT. With Jax, the training time is much faster. 

## How-to 
Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/meredithoopis/rl_impls.git
```

### To test the algorithm, simply navigate to the corresponding folder, for example: 
```
cd PPO
python PPO.py 
```
and manipulate the hyperparameters to your needs.
